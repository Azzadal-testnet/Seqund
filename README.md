# Seqund !

**DNA sequencing webapp**

Under our end of year project, we worked on a bio-technology project. **Seqund** is a webapp, it's goal is to help bio-tecnitions convert genome data files. as of today we worked on the (.sff) to (.fasta/fastq) conversion that helps with getting a data format that is easier to analyse under current technology tools.
